# Controlling 
<hr> 
<p> Now comes the phase where we need to check if our code works. For that, we wrote 10 Testing protocols where we would always check one thing and see if that worked (for example: starting the game.)</p>

## Testcase 
<p> We have done 10 different Test protocols, but they were all different sizes and all with different details. To make it easier for our teacher, we decided to also make a test case where we did a summary of all test protocols.</p>
