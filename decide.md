## Decison Matrix 

Before we started making the game, we both had to decide on what game engine were going to use. We agreed on GODOT because Leon already had a little bit Experience with it. We didnt have any problems deciding what Engine we use to program the website, because we only know VS studio Code.

<ul>
<li>Experience</li>
<p>We agreed on that the Experince is the most important thing, because we dont have to learn anything or less things. </p>
  
<li>Language simplicity</li>
<p>The language simplicity was important because, if don't know how something works we can watch a tutorial and understand it easier. Also if we have a problem we could solve it easier, since if the code would be complicated and more complex, it would be harder to find the error and correct it</p>

<li>Software simplicity</li>
<p> We wanted a simple but useful engine. For us it would be easier to learn it and implement things.</p>

<li>Features</li>
<p>If the engine has some useful features, we would profit from it, but it wasnt that important so we didnt prioritize it so much.</p></p>

</ul>
