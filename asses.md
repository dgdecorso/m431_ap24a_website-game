<li> We could organize our time better, even tough we did in time a little bit more time could've been useful.</li>

</ul>

<hr> 

#### What difficulties/problems have been faced? 
<ul>
<li>We didn't have any big problems. The only "Problem" that we had was the start, at first we had problems to understand the Progress itself. We didn't understand GitHub too. But after some time it wasn't a problem anymore.</li>

<li>We had to rush the last part a little bit, because if we wouldn't have rushed it we wouldnt't have done it in time.</li>
</ul>
